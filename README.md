# Petri (Client-Side/Front-End)
A *research-focused* web-app designed for increasing lab productivity and workflow.

- This repository houses the client-side of my web application *Petri*. As such, most of the details mentioned here are largely front-end related. If you want to learn about my API (server-side) please visit [Petri's server-side repository](https://github.com/Haz-git/Petri_Server_Build).

### Introduction
---
*Petri* was developed as a passion project during the pursuit of my Master's degree in Human Biology (more specifically, Microbiology and Molecular Biology). While I was performing research, I was frequently frustrated at the lack of research(specifically wetlab)-oriented applications to make our lives easier. Now, good ones do exist, but they were far from simple and much too expensive for our small lab's use-case.

My obsession with coding, creation, and research soon led to the development of *Petri*.

As a self-taught developer, working through this project massively improved my knowledge about full-stack software development.

*Petri's* **Lazy Lac-Z** is a *custom-made* science tool for the Beta-Galactosidase assay we perform frequently in our lab. The graphs are generated dynamically based on user inputs, and all data is saved server-sided.
