# Petri (Client-Side/Front-End)
---
A *research-focused* web-app designed for increasing lab productivity and workflow.

### Introduction
---
- This repository houses the client-side of my web application *Petri*. As such, most of the details mentioned here are largely front-end related. If you want to learn about my API (server-side) please visit [Petri's server-side repository](https://github.com/Haz-git/Petri_Server_Build).
- *Petri* was developed as a passion project during the pursuit of my Master's degree in Human Biology (more specifically, Microbiology and Molecular Biology). As a self-taught developer, this working through this project helped me learn much more about full-stack software development.
